### **Step 3: Add and Push the README to GitHub**

Now that you've created the file, you need to add it to your Git repository and push it to GitHub. This is a simple, standard commit.

From your **root `psalm-app` folder**,
*   Navigate to the backend directory.
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```
*   Create and activate a Python virtual environment.
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
     run these commands:

```bash
# Stage the new README.md file for commit
git add README.md

# Create a commit with a descriptive message
git commit -m "Docs: Add comprehensive README.md file"

# Push the new commit to your main branch on GitHub
git push origin main
